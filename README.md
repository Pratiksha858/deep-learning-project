# deep-learning-project
Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting employee status in a corporate environment using a historical dataset. The dataset was preprocessed to handle imbalanced classes and normalized using Min-Max scaling. The ANN architecture was customized with multiple hidden layers and appropriate activation functions. The model was trained and evaluated on the preprocessed dataset, achieving high accuracy and performance metrics. Careful consideration was given to potential data leakage, and validation steps were taken to ensure reliable results. The project aimed to provide insights into employee retention and termination dynamics while addressing challenges associated with imbalanced data and neural network tuning
